        Hi there! My name is Alfonso and I am a software developer, community leader, and full-time lover of food.
        I am currently enrolled at Rutgers University, studying Computer Science, Math, and Philosophy.

      <p>
        When not in
        class I enjoy eating food, gaming, and working on random projects! I also love being a part of Rutgers'
        Computer Science community and help a variety of the different clubs on campus.

      <h3>Pearson K12 Learning</h3>
      <img class="photo" src="assets/Interns.png" alt="">
      <p>
        During Summer of 2019 I worked at Pearosn K12 in Boston. I worked on a variety of different projects and expanded my knowledge
        in different fields of Software Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first I worked closely with the DevOps team to create python tools that assisted in monitoring the company's network.
        I used Python to build Nagios Core Service to notify 100+ engineers when any of 500+ SSL Certificates were close to expiring.
        I also used Python to write a script to check what CDN was being used for the 100+ endpoints in order to assist in data migration
      </p>
      <p>
        After finishing work on these tools I was asked to create a proof of concept application to replace a current tool available to students.
        I also used React Native, Google Vision, Express.js and Node.js to build a photo-recognition app to scan 1000+ textbook pages from 100+
        textbooks for links and additional material for a learning tool.

        Since Sophomore year I worked with the professors in the mathematics department as well as one other student in order to grade assignments
        and provide feedback on the topics that need more coverage in lecture.

      <p>
        HackRU is the largest Bi-annual hackathon in New Jersey. Here we work with a variety of different sponsors and clubs
        on campus to host our 24 hour event and foster an environment of learning as well as community.
      </p>
      <p>
        As one of the two executive directors I oversee the 50+ person organization as well as handle communication with the
        University's administration.

    <div class="col">
      <img class="photo" src="assets/ChiPhi.jpg" alt="">
      <p>
        In the Spring of my Sophomore year I joined the Chi Phi Fraternity. A social fraternity on campus that has been at Rutgers since 1864. Here we have worked closely with the
        University, other organizations, and New Brunswick to give back to the community. Some of the philanthropy work that we
        do includes working with the Boys and Girls Club of America as well as help the nearby New Brunswick community gardens.
      </p>
      <p>
        This past summer I created the Chi Phi website as well as a dashboard that allows for the exective board to update
        information without having knowledge with programming. More information can be found in the project section.
